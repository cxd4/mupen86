<p>There are a few plugins which are hard to obtain.  On Microsoft Windows, many alternatives exist.  Otherwise, these plugins have poorly updated public releases, or the source to compiling them by hand was usually integrated as part of the Mupen64 emulator source (an integration severed by this fork of Mupen64 to keep the repository cleaner and more modular).  For your convenience, here are some binary downloads to some plugins I have compiled that involve such problems with obtaining.</p>
<p>The version of the C library used to link the plugins is the <code>glibc-5.23</code> package.  As Slackware focuses on stability and is very slow to update to the newest versions of packages, all of these files should load on your preferred distribution of choice as long as you have maintained it to be reasonably up-to-date.</p>

<p>Did not see the plugin you were hoping to find a pre-compiled release for?  Maybe it is one of the plugins still being actively updated today, in which case it is far easier to get the latest version with an easy pull via Git to make from source.  Examples:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/purplemarshmallow/z64/">z64gl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Azimer/AziAudio/">Azimer's audio plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cxd4/n64-keyboard/">a basic but well-featured keyboard input plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cxd4/rsp/">Static Interpreter RSP project</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Licensing Matters</h2>
<p>Any pre-compiled binary releases uploaded to this site were made with no modifications to the original source, beyond possibly what may have been needed to get it to compile (e.g., ../main/winlnxdefs.h from under the GPL-licensed Mupen64 project, which contains type definitions referenced by the plugins that may have needed fixing to provide a 64-bit build and has its open-source improvements available in this repository).  The source code to these plugins is all available as part of Hacktarux's original source release to Mupen64 0.5, and unlicensed or fully copyrighted files like the sources to glN64 required no changes.</p>
